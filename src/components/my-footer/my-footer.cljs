;; Script tags inside the shadow DOM are not executed in the same way
;; they would be if they were in the main document. When you include a
;; script tag inside the shadow root, it does not have the same global
;; scope as when itâ€™s included in the main document. Therefore, the script
;; may not load or execute as expected within the shadow DOM context.
